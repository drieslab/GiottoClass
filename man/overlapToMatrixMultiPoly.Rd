\description{
create a count matrix based on overlap results
from \code{\link{calculateOverlapRaster}},
\code{\link{calculateOverlapSerial}},
or \code{\link{calculateOverlapParallel}}
and aggregate information from multiple polygon
layers (e.g. z-stacks) together
}
\examples{
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")

overlapToMatrixMultiPoly(g, poly_info = "z0")
