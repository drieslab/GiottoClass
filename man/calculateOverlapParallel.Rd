\usage{
calculateOverlapParallel(
  gobject,
  name_overlap = NULL,
  spatial_info = "cell",
  feat_info = "rna",
  poly_ID_names = "all",
  polygon_group_size = 500,
  return_gobject = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gobject}{giotto object}

\item{name_overlap}{name for the overlap
results (default to feat_info parameter)}

\item{spatial_info}{polygon information}

\item{feat_info}{feature information}

\item{poly_ID_names}{list of poly_IDs to use}

\item{polygon_group_size}{number of polygons to process per
parallelization group}

\item{return_gobject}{return giotto object (default: TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{be verbose}
}
\value{
giotto object or spatVector with overlapping information
}
\description{
calculate overlap between cellular
structures (polygons) and features (points)
}
\details{
parallel follows the future approach. This means that
plan(multisession) does not work,
since the underlying terra objects are internal C pointers.
plan(multicore) is also not supported for
Rstudio users.

g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")
