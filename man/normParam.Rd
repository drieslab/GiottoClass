\description{
Utility class that defines a data normalization procedure and any params
used in performing it. This is a VIRTUAL mother class. Packages defining normalization
methods (and ways to implement them on data structures) will create their
own child classes. These parameter objects are intended to be passed
alongside the data to normalize to \code{\link[=normalizeData]{normalizeData()}}.
