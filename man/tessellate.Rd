\usage{
tessellate(
  extent,
  shape = c("hexagon", "square"),
  shape_size = NULL,
  gap = 0,
  radius = NULL,
  id_prefix = "ID_",
  name = "grid"

}
\arguments{
\item{extent}{SpatExtent or anything else a SpatExtent can be extracted or
created from}

\item{shape}{Shape of the tessellation grid. Available options are "hexagon"
and "square".}

\item{shape_size}{numeric. Size of shape to tessellate. (x-axis width for
hexagons, side length for squares)}

\item{gap}{numeric. Shrink polygons to add a gap between tessellated polygons}

\item{radius}{deprecated. numeric. Radius size of the tessellation grid.}

\item{id_prefix}{character. prefix to add to poly_ID names generated}

\item{name}{name of giottoPolygons grid to make}
}
\value{
A giottoPolygon
}
\description{
Generates a tessellated grid of polygons within the provided
spatial extent
}
\details{
This function generates a tessellated grid of spatial locations
based on the input spatial locations. The shape of the tessellation grid
can be either hexagonal or square. The shape_size parameter determines the
size of the grid cells or the bin size.
}
\examples{
# Create an extent across which to generate tessellated polygons
e <- ext(0, 100, 0, 100)
# produce hexagons with a diameter of 10
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "hexagon", shape_size = 10)
plot(x)

# same size grid, but now with a gap
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "hexagon", shape_size = 10, gap = 1)
plot(x)

# square grid with a gap
x <- tessellate(extent = e, shape = "square", shape_size = 10, gap = 1)
plot(x)
