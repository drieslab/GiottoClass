\value{
a giotto object with updated image pointer
}
\description{
reconnect a gobject's dead image pointers using filepaths to
the original source image files
}
\details{
Inputs can either be given as both image
name (\code{image_name}/\code{largeImage_name}) and
filepath (\code{image_path}/\code{largeImage_path}) args or as only a named
list through a filepath argument alone. If \code{auto_reconnect = TRUE} then
no additional params need to be supplied. As long as giotto image objects
were directly created using filepaths, those filepaths are stored within
the image objects and will be referenced during reconnection. Issues will
only arise if giotto image objects were created directly from the underlying
image handling package objects (\emph{magick} or \emph{raster objects}) or
if image files have been moved since the the giotto image object was
generated. In such cases, use manual reconnection by
setting \code{auto_reconnect = FALSE}.
