\description{
Generic for processing an object containing measured values.
Specific methods should be defined for this generic to
perform pre or post processing specific to a data class type. No methods
are exported from \pkg{GiottoClass}. The methods, which may
differ depending on the input data, are attached from other packages which
focus on analyses and/or alternative data representations with specific ways
to implement those analyses.
