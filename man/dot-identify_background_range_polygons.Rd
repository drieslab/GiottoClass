\title{Identify background range polygons}
\usage{
.identify_background_range_polygons(spatVector, threshold = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatVector}{terra polygon spatvector}

\item{threshold}{if a polygon's x AND y range exceeds this fraction of the
overall \code{SpatVector} extent, it will be flagged for removal.}
}
\value{
A character vector of polygon IDs of variable length (but usually
only either length 0 i.e. no background poly to remove, or 1, being the
background poly to remove) if used with a correct threshold.
}
\description{
function to remove background polygon by comparing individual
polygon vertex xy ranges against the overall \code{SpatVector} extent. Each
\code{SpatVector} that this function is run on MUST contain only those polygons
that were generated as part of the same FOV. This is because the individual
polygons are compared against the overall extent which is assumed to be
roughly that of the original mask image.
}
\examples{
sv <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoPolygon")[]

# should not find anything
.identify_background_range_polygons(sv, threshold = 0.9)
