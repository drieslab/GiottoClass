  ...,
  fmt = "poly_\%d",
  previous_id = "source_id"

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{geometry class to combine or split.}

\item{by}{character. Column name of variable used to group the geometries.
Will be used as the new \code{poly_ID} column. All geometries will be combined
if not provided.}

\item{dissolve}{logical. Should borders between aggregated geometries be dissolved?}

\item{fun}{function used to aggregate values. Either an actual function, or for the following, their name: "mean", "max", "min", "median", "sum", "modal", "any", "all", "prod", "which.min", "which.max", "table", "sd" (sample standard deviation) and "std" (population standard deviation)}

\item{...}{additional params to pass to \code{\link[terra:aggregate]{terra::aggregate()}} (and then to
\code{fun}, such as \code{na.rm=TRUE}) or \code{\link[terra:disaggregate]{terra::disagg()}}}

\item{fmt}{character. sprintf formatting to use to generate \code{poly_ID} column
values if no attributes are retained after combining.}

\item{previous_id}{character. If not \code{NULL}, column name to store original
poly_ID values under. Note that merged IDs will be \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
the same class as \code{x}
}
\description{
Geometries can be either single/simple or multi with multiple closed rings
defined as a single record. \code{combineGeom()} is used to combine polygons.
\code{splitGeom()} breaks combined geometries down into constituent parts.\cr
Avoid using the \code{SpatVector} methods. They are lower-level and does not
deal with IDs like might be expected by Giotto.
}
\details{
Currently, these are simple wrappers around terra's
\code{aggregate(dissolve = FALSE)} and \code{disagg()} with some additional handling
around the \code{poly_ID} column and a different name to avoid confusion with
spatial feature aggregation.

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{combineGeom(SpatVector)}: Avoid using.

\item \code{splitGeom(SpatVector)}: Avoid using.

}}
\section{Geometry Attributes Handling}{
\itemize{
\item \code{combineGeom()} attributes are only kept if \code{by} param is used. For
conflicts where more than one value is present for a single variable after
combining, they are resolved using \code{fun} param.
When \code{by=NULL}, all attributes are dropped and a default \code{poly_ID} column
is generated based on the \code{fmt} param.
\item \code{splitGeom()} attributes are duplicated for each part that was part of the
same multipolygon. The \code{poly_ID} column will be made unique.
\item overlaps and centroids information will be dropped after either operation.
