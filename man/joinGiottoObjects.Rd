\description{
Function to join multiple giotto objects together
}
\details{
This function joins both the expression and spatial information of
multiple giotto objects into a single one. Giotto supports multiple ways of
joining spatial information as selected through param \code{join_method}:

\itemize{
\item{\strong{\code{"shift"}}} {
(default) Spatial locations of different datasets are shifted
by numeric vectors of values supplied through \code{x_shift},
\code{y_shift}, \code{x_padding}, and \code{y_padding}. This is
particularly useful for data
that is provided as tiles or ROIs or when analyzing multiple spatial
datasets together and keeping their spatial data separate.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\\strong\{If shift values are given then a value is needed for each giotto
object to be joined in \code{gobject_list}. Order matters.\}

If a regular step value is desired instead of a specific list of values,
use \code{x_padding} and \code{y_padding}. Both shift and padding values
can be used at the same time.

Leaving \code{x_shift} and \code{y_shift} values as \code{NULL} will
have Giotto estimate an appropriate \code{x_shift} value based on the
x dimension of available image objects. If no image objects are
available, a default behavior of \code{x_padding = 1000} will be applied.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

}
\item{\strong{\code{"z_stack"}}} {
Datasets are spatially combined with no change to x and y
spatial locations, but a z value is incorporated for each dataset based
on input supplied through param \code{z_vals}. To specify a z value for
each dataset to join, a numeric vector must be given with a value for
each element in \code{gobject_list}. Order matters.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{Alternatively, a single numeric value can be supplied to \code{z_vals}
in which case this input will be treated as a z step value.
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

}
\item{\strong{\code{"no_change"}}} {
No changes are applied to the spatial locations of the datasets when
joining.
}
