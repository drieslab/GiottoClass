\description{
Class extending \code{giottoLargeImage}. When \code{shear()} or \code{spin()} operations
are performed on a \code{giottoLargeImage}, this class is instantiated. It
provides a way of storing the affine transformation and also lazily
performing it when required for a plotting preview. It is possible to force
the deferred affine transform using \code{doDeferred()} and return a processed
\code{giottoLargeImage}.
