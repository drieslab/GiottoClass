\usage{
convert_to_full_spatial_network(reduced_spatial_network_DT)
}
\arguments{
\item{reduced_spatial_network_DT}{reduced spatial network in \code{data.table}
format}
}
\value{
data.table
}
\description{
Convert to a full spatial network, ie ensuring that all edges
that may currently only be represented as \eqn{a} -> \eqn{b} also have the
reverse \eqn{b} -> \eqn{a}. The entries are then made unique, after which all
interactions are ranked by distance, where rank increases from smaller to
larger distances. This rank is appended to the \code{data.table} as a \code{rank_int}
column. Another \code{rnk_src_trgt} column is added with the IDs of \eqn{a} and
\eqn{b} pasted together
}
\examples{
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")
