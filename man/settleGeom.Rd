\title{Settle polygon bounds}
\usage{
\S4method{settleGeom}{giottoPolygon}(x)

\S4method{settleGeom}{SpatVector}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{SpatVector} of type "polygons" or object inheriting from
\code{giottoPolygon}}
}
\value{
same class as \code{x}, with the contained polygons borders settled
in relation to each other.
}
\description{
Settle the boundaries between polygons when they overlap by
splitting both at the point where they touch. Works through intersection
with the voronoi of the centroids.
}
\examples{
svp <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("giottoPolygon")[]
svp <- buffer(svp, 5)
plot(svp)
svp <- settleGeom(svp)
plot(svp)
