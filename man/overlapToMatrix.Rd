}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object containing overlaps info. Can be giotto object or SpatVector
points or data.table of overlaps generated from \code{calculateOverlap}}

\item{name}{name for the overlap count matrix}

\item{poly_info}{character. Polygon information to use}

\item{feat_info}{character. Feature information to use}

\item{type}{character. Type of overlap data (either 'point' or 'intensity')}

\item{count_info_column}{column with count information}

\item{aggr_function}{function to aggregate image information (default = sum)}

\item{return_gobject}{return giotto object (default: TRUE)}

\item{verbose}{be verbose}

\item{\dots}{additional params to pass to methods}

\item{output}{data format/class to return the results as}

\item{col_names, row_names}{character vector. (optional) Set of row and col
names that are expected to exist. This fixes the dimensions of the matrix
since the overlaps information does not directly report rows and cols where
no values were detected.}
}
\value{
giotto object or count matrix
}
\description{
create a count matrix based on overlap results from
\code{\link{calculateOverlap}}
}
\examples{
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("vizgen")
gpoly <- getPolygonInfo(g,
    polygon_name = "aggregate",
    return_giottoPolygon = TRUE
)
gpoints <- getFeatureInfo(g, return_giottoPoints = TRUE)

# calculate all transcripts overlapped
out_all <- calculateOverlap(gpoly, gpoints)
