\title{Create a buffer around vector geometries}
\usage{
\S4method{buffer}{spatLocsObj}(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)

\S4method{buffer}{giottoPoints}(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)

\S4method{buffer}{giottoPolygon}(x, width, ..., settle = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SpatRaster or SpatVector}

\item{width}{numeric. Unit is meter if \code{x} has a longitude/latitude CRS, or in the units of the coordinate reference system in other cases (typically also meter). The value should be > 0 if \code{x} is a SpatRaster. If \code{x} is a SpatVector, this argument is vectorized, meaning that you can provide a different value for each geometry in \code{x}; and you can also use the name of a variable in \code{x} that has the widths}

\item{\dots}{additional params to pass}

\item{settle}{logical. Settle the borders between polygons by cutting them
where they touch based on voronoi boundaries.}
}
\value{
\code{giottoPolygon} of buffer polygons
}
\description{
Calculate a buffer around all geometries of a \code{SpatVector}
}
\examples{
sl <- GiottoData::loadSubObjectMini("spatLocsObj")
slb <- buffer(sl, 30)
plot(slb)
