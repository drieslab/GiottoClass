Retrieve specific values from the \code{giotto} object for a specific \code{spat_unit}
and \code{feat_type}. Values are returned as a data.table with the features
requested and a \code{cell_ID} column. This function may be updated in the future
to search in additional sets of information. To see the currently available
slot it checks, see details.
}
\details{
\strong{[search]}\cr
spatValues searches through the set of available information within the
\code{giotto} object for matches to \code{feats}. The current search order is
\enumerate{
\item cell expression
\item{cell metadata}
\item{spatial enrichment}
\item{polygon info}
}
If a specific name for one of the types of information is provided via a
param such as \code{expression_values}, \code{spat_enr_name}, \code{poly_info}, then
the search will only be performed on that type of data.\cr\cr
\strong{[debug]}\cr
This function uses Giotto's accessor functions which can usually throw errors
whenever a specific set of data or the features within that set do not
exist. This function muffles those errors, and only sends an error that the
data was not found when all getters fail. By setting \code{debug = TRUE}, you can
see the errors returned from each failed getter printed as messages for
easier debugging.
