\description{
Generic for normalizing an object containing measured values.
\code{normalizeData()} is intended as the central API for accessing
normalization workflows. Specific methods should be defined for it to
help with pre or post processing specific to a data class type. No methods
for normalization are exported from \pkg{GiottoClass}. The methods, which may
differ depending on the input data, are attached from other packages which
focus on analyses and/or alternative data representations.
